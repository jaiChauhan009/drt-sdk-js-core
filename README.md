Feel free to skip this section if you are not a contributor.

### Prerequisites

`browserify` is required to compile the browser-friendly versions of `sdk-core`. It can be installed as follows:

```
npm install --global browserify
```

### Building the library

In order to compile the library, run the following:

```
npm install
npm run compile
npm run compile-browser
```

### Running the tests

In order to run the tests **on NodeJS**, do as follows:

```
npm run tests-unit
npm run tests-localnet
npm run tests-devnet
npm run tests-testnet
```

Before running the tests **in the browser**, make sure you have the package `http-server` installed globally.

```
npm install --global http-server
```

In order to run the tests **in the browser**, do as follows:

```
make clean && npm run browser-tests
```

For the `localnet` tests, make sure you have a _local testnet_ up & running. In order to start a _local testnet_, follow [this](https://docs.multiversx.com/developers/setup-local-testnet/).

### Generating the documentation

API documentation is generated from the source code using [api-extractor](https://api-extractor.com).

Prerequisites:

```
npm install -g @microsoft/api-extractor
npm install -g @microsoft/api-documenter
```

In order to (re)generate the documentation, run the following:

```
npm run api:extract
npm run api:document
```
